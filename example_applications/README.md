## Applications Example

We present an example of running the EDAME algorithm on a sample healthy dataset `1_LifeLinesDeep_2016_healthy.relative.abundance.csv` given in the current folder.

The jupyter notebook can be used directly to run this script without any additional data or scripts. 

The html file `0_healthy.html` is the output of the script `0_healthy.ipynb`.

Please refer to the html file `0_healthy.html` to see the details of the algorithm.
